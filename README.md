# MultinomialLR
This Algorithm is implemented based on paper
"Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Logistic Regression Models: Theory and Implementation"

It provides a way to calculate p-value using Z-score.
The p-value is defined as the probability of obtaining a result 
equal to or "more extreme" than what was actually observed, when the null hypothesis is true.
